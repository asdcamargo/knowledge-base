## Big Data - Initial Concepts

### Sources 
- Machines: IoT, real time sensors, largest source of data. 
- People: Social media, usually in text form and unstructured.
- Organizations: Traditional types of data, structure often stored in warehouses. 

### Characteristics and Challenges
- Volume: Vast amount of data, generate in a shor amount of time: seconds, minutes, hours or days.
- Variety: Differents forms tha data can come: text, images, geospacial, etc. Refers to the heterogenity of data. Insert more complexity due to more kinds of data.
- Velocity: Speed that data is generated.
- Veracity: Refers to the uncertainty of data. 
- Valence: Connections of data in the form of graphs.

### Data format
- Unstructured: Does not conform with a pre defined data model. It's usually on the text form. Include any format that is made for human comprehension: PDF, XML, documents, images, and much more.  
- Structured:  Complies with a pre defined data model. Usually is related to operations and bussiness systems. It's storaged in relational databases. Commonly used by organizations: transations, products, sales, etc.

### Structured + Unstructured
- Leverages the potential of data. 
- Allow to extract more valuable information.
- Give more assurance to the bussiness decisions based on reliability taken from the data integration.
- Gives more assurance to the business decisions based on reliability of the data integration. 

## Data Science - Extract Knowledge from Data
### Steps in Data Sciense Process 
- Acquire: Identify data sets, retrieve data, query data. 
- Prepare: Explore data: look at the data to understand its quality and format. Pre-process data: clean data, integrate and package.
- Analyze: Selection of analytical techniques to use and build models. This step require multiple iterations.
- Report: Present the results in a visual way.
- Act: Report the insights from the analysis and define the actions based on the insghts found. 

### Categories of Analysis Techniques
- Classification: Predict a category of the input data, e.g. classify the weather as sunny, windy, rainy, etc. 
- Regression: Predict a numeric value, e.g. predict the price of a stock. 
- Clustering: Organize similar items into groups, e.g. group a company customer in groups like seniors, adults, teenagers. 
- Association Analysis: Find rules to capture associations between items, determine when items or events occur togheter, e.g. market basket analysis is used to understand customer purchase behavior, which products are bought together.
- Graph Analytics: Use graph structures to find connections between entities, e.g. explore the spread of a disease, identification of security threats.
