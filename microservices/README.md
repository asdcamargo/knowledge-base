## Microservices

### Concept

** Microservices architecture provides a new approach to develop applications. As opposed to monolithic applications, in which the application comprises a single software artifact, a Microservices application is composed by a set of services, each one designed to perform a single and well-defined task. These services allow the development team to decouple several parts of the application using different frameworks, languages and hardware for each part of the system.
