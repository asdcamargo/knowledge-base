# Microservices

## Concept

* Microservices architecture refers to an approach for developing applications as a set of small loosely coupled services that uses a lightweight network protocol to communicate with each other [4]. As opposed to monolithic applications, in which the application comprises a single software artifact, a Microservices application is composed by a set of services, each one designed to perform a single and well-defined task. These services allow the development team to decouple several parts of the application using different frameworks, languages and hardware for each part of the system.
* The approach is targeted to the internal organization of an application not the application external boundaries such as its communication with other applications or services. By breaking the application complexity into a set of services, a change can affect only one component and not the whole application itself. Besides that, each service can be provided considering its hardware constraints using only the necessary resources and using the best technology for each purpose, leading to cost reduction with development and infrastructure
